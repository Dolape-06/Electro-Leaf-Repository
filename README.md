# Audio-Reactive LED Strip

Welcome to the **Audio-Reactive LED Strip** project! ðŸŽ¶âœ¨

This project combines the power of FastLED and Arduino to create an LED strip that reacts to sound in real-time. With a simple microphone sensor and a few lines of code, you can transform your LED setup into an interactive light show that syncs with your environment.

## Features
- **Sound Reactivity**: LEDs change dynamically based on sound input.
- **RGB Control**: Customize the colors of your LED strip with Bluetooth commands.
- **Simple and Customizable**: The code is easy to modify, making it a great starting point for beginners and advanced users alike.

## Hardware Requirements
- WS2811/WS2812 or compatible LED strip.
- Arduino-compatible microcontroller.
- Microphone sensor (e.g., KY-038 or similar).
- Bluetooth module (optional for RGB control).

## How to Build
1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the wiring instructions in the code comments.
3. Upload the provided code to your Arduino.
4. Enjoy the light and sound experience!
